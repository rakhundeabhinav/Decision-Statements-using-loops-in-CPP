 🚀 Experiment 6: Decision Statements using Loops in C++
 
📌 Aim

To study and implement the use of decision making statements combined with loops in C++ for solving logical and repetitive problems.

📚 Theory

C++ provides:

Decision statements (if, else, switch) for making logical choices.

Loops (for, while, do...while) to repeat a set of instructions.

Combining both allows us to handle real-life logic inside loops, enabling dynamic and interactive program flows.


🧑‍💻 Programs and Descriptions:

🔹Password Lock – Keeps asking for the password until the correct one is entered.

🔹Print Even Numbers – Prints all even numbers from 1 to a given number.

🔹Print Name 5 Times – Displays your name five times using a loop.

🔹Reverse Digits – Reverses the digits of a given number.

🔹Star Pattern – Prints a right-angled triangle using stars.

🔹Pyramid Pattern – Prints a centered pyramid made of stars.

🔹Inverted Star Pattern – Displays a star pattern in inverted triangle form.

🔹Floyd’s Triangle – Prints numbers in a triangular pattern using Floyd’s logic.

✅ Conclusion

Through these programs, I explored how loops and decision statements work together to create dynamic and interactive C++ applications. I practiced a variety of real-world tasks like input validation, pattern printing, number reversal, and learned how logic flows within repeated structures.
